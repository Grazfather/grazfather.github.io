      <description>While packers&amp;rsquo; original intention is to minimize the size of a binary, they are often used today as an &amp;lsquo;easy&amp;rsquo; form of obfuscation, making us reverse engineers&amp;rsquo; lives more difficult. In order to get around them it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand how they work in practice first.
Since writing an application that is intended to be packed is a pain the ass, packing is usually done as a separate step, and most packers can work basically agnostic of the content of what it&amp;rsquo;s packing.</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know where I got these notes from, but I found them on my evernote and I thought they were worth exporting here.
Data-based obfuscation  Constant Unfolding  A compiler would do something like replace x = 4 * 5 with x = 20. This does the opposite.  e.g. push 0F9CBE47ah, add dword ptr [esp], 6341B86h. This is effectively push 0h.     Dead Code Insertion  Simply add code that has no effect but wastes the reverse engineer&amp;rsquo;s time.</description>
