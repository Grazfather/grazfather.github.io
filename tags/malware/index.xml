      <description>This is just a small collection of notes about disassembly and anti-disassembly tricks, and how to get around them.
How disassemblers work The simplest disassembler is super simple, but they can also be very complicated. More advanced disassemblers try to recognize things like functions (which may have multiples returns), idioms like jump tables, and not get tricked by anti-disassembly tricks. They come in two general categories.
 Linear - Dissassembles all instructions in order, starting from some point (usually the entry point of a binary).</description>

      <description>I owe Practical Malware Analysis for kickstarting my career in security. Before reading it (and getting into CTFs) I was working as an embedded systems developer, and then a developer at a bug bounty company.
PMA has got to be the best technical book I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. On the OpenToAll slack it&amp;rsquo;s the book I&amp;rsquo;m mostly likely to recommend, and that&amp;rsquo;s what I am doing here. I&amp;rsquo;ve worked through every lab in the book, currently available on my github.</description>
